  Rock or Mine prediction
</h1>
<h3>
  we have used logistic regression model to predict its a rock or a mine. we train the model from existing data first split the dataset into test or train data then train it and fing the accuracy.
  if the accuracy is above 75% then its a good model and our accuracy percentage is 84% after that we can give the input to the model and it will predict that it is a rock or a mine.
